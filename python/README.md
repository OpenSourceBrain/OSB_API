### OSB API in Python

This is a standalone Python package for interacting with the Open Source Brain website.

It can be used to query the list of projects present on OSB, get metadata such as the tags 
for each project or the ModelDB reference, or the link to the associated GitHub repositories.

See more info on usage [here](http://opensourcebrain.org/docs#OSB_API).

Example scripts can be found in https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/OSB_API/tree/master/python/examples.
